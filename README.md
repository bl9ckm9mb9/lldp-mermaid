Play LLDP with Mermaid

This Python script makes use of Ansible and Mermaid in order to draw out a network diagram, using LLDP commands.
Ansible pushes out the commands and Mermaid is the markdown language syntax used to write out the diagram in a Text Editor, like Typora.

In order to successfully run this script, you will need to following:

* Ansible
* Typora
* Python 3
* access to the targeted device(s)
